# Final Project Explanation
# King Count: Food Inspection & Yelp Data
This project focuses on Food Establishment Data from King County, as well as
Yelp Data.
We utilized these data sets to find information about food safety violations,
rating scores, inspection scores, prices and reviews. We have provided
visualizations to showcase the relationship between various features in the
data sets. This application may be useful to people trying to find which
restaurants have certain food safety ratings, or certain prices, or certain
reviews, etc...
